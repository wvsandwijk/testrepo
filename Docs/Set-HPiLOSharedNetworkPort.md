# Set-HPiLOSharedNetworkPort

## SYNOPSIS
Configures Lights-Out device to pass network traffic on the shared host network port.
(C) Copyright 2013, 2014 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-HPiLOSharedNetworkPort [-OutputType <String>] [-Username <Object>] [-Password <Object>]
 [-Credential <Object>] [-Force] [-Server <Object>] [-SNPPort <Object>] [-SharedNetworkPort <Object>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Set-HPiLOSharedNetworkPort cmdlet configures Lights-Out device to pass network traffic on the shared host network port.
On servers that do not support this feature, this script generates an error.
You must have Configure iLO Settings privilege to execute this command.
When using the iLO Shared Network Port, flashing the iLO firmware through the XML interface takes approximately 7 minutes to complete.
Flashing the firmware using Shared Network Port with iLO does not take any longer to complete than using the dedicated iLO management port.
NOTE: Due to a branding change, the values for Set-HPiLOSharedNetworkPort have changed.
For iLO 4 1.01, the values are LOM, FlexLOM, and No.
For iLO 4 1.05 and later, the values are LOM, FlexibleLOM, and No.
For iLO 3, the values are Yes or No. 
For iLO, the Shared Network Port feature is only available on servers with hardware, NIC firmware, and iLO firmware that supports this feature.
A list of servers(with or without port number) and corresponding username/password or credential values must be provided as parameters.
WARNING: When this cmdlet is successfully executed, the iLO reboots to apply the changes.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOSharedNetworkPort -SNPPort 1
Please enter Server IP or Hostname: 1.4.217.131,187
Do you want to add details for another server?(Y/N) : y
Please enter Server IP or Hostname: 1.4.209.53
Do you want to add details for another server?(Y/N) : n

Username is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Username for these servers? (Y/N) : N
Enter Username for 1.4.217.131: administrator
Enter Username for 1.4.217.187: alansmith
Enter Username for 1.4.209.53: timhorton

Password is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Password for these servers? (Y/N) : N
Enter Password for 1.4.217.131: ************
Enter Password for 1.4.217.187: ************
Enter Password for 1.4.209.53: ************

SharedNetworkPort is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same SharedNetworkPort for these servers? (Y/N) : N
Enter SharedNetworkPort for 1.4.217.131: LOM
Enter SharedNetworkPort for 1.4.217.187: No
Enter SharedNetworkPort for 1.4.209.53: No
```

This command shows a basic usage scenario where only the cmdlet name is entered.
You are asked if the same credentials are to be used for multiple input servers or if separate credentials have to be collected for each server.
Then you are asked if the same values for parameters are to be passed to the cmdlets or separate parameters are going to be used for each server.
A list of iLO details is passed to the cmdlet in the form of PowerShell object or list of PowerShell objects or list of IP addresses of the iLO.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOSharedNetworkPort -Server $Server -SharedNetworkPort No -SNPPort 1

Username is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Username for these servers? (Y/N) : Y
Please enter Username : alansmith

Password is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Password for these servers? (Y/N) : Y
Please enter Password : ************
```

$Server is passed as parameter to Set-HPiLOSharedNetworkPort.
It can be a string array having iLO IP addresses in string format or it can be an array of PowerShell objects having iLO details including IP address. 
Because the username and passwords are not provided for the iLOs, you are asked to input these values.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOSharedNetworkPort -Server $Server -Username $Username -Password $Password -SharedNetworkPort $SharedNetworkPort -SNPPort $SNPPort
```

This command shows that the list of iLO server addresses is passed as a parameter along with usernames and passwords.

## PARAMETERS

The PowerShell object may contain fields such as IP Address, Hostname, spn, fwri, pn, MAC address.
The object may also contain the userid and password required to access the iLO.
A range of iLO IPs can also be provided in the same string.
IPv6 values for IP address can be used on iLO3 firmware version 1.70 and later and also on iLO4 firmware version 1.40 and later.

For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### PSObject OR array of PSObject OR String OR array of String
You can pipe one IP address or a list of IP addresses as Strings, or one PSObject or list of PSObjects having the iLO details such as IP Address, Hostname, Username and Password to access the iLO.

## OUTPUTS

### 
Use Get-Member to get details of fields in returned objects.

## NOTES
Some forms of command line parameters must be enclosed in quotes for correct interpretation by the system.
For example a string parameter of 1234 is interpreted as a number instead of a string without quotes.
An IP address set of 10.10.10.11,33 would also be misinterpreted. 
Use either "1234" or "10.10.10.11,33" to get the expected results.
