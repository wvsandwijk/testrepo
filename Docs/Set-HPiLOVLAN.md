# Set-HPiLOVLAN

## SYNOPSIS
Configures the iLO Shared Network Port with a user defined VLAN ID.
(C) Copyright 2013, 2014 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-HPiLOVLAN [-OutputType <String>] [-Username <Object>] [-Password <Object>] [-Credential <Object>] [-Force]
 [-Server <Object>] [-EnableNIC <Object>] [-SharedNetworkPort <Object>] [-VLAN <Object>] [-VLANID <Object>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Set-HPiLOVLAN cmdlet configures the iLO Shared Network Port with a user defined VLAN ID.
Once the script has successfully completed, the iLO management processor reboots to apply the changes.
If connectivity to iLO is lost, use the RBSU to reconfigure the network settings to values that are compatible with the network environment.
You must have Configure iLO Settings privilege to execute this command.
A list of servers(with or without port number) and corresponding username/password or credential values must be provided as parameters.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOVLAN -EnableNIC Yes -SharedNetworkPort $SharedNetworkPort -$VLANEnabled No
Please enter Server IP or Hostname: 1.4.217.131,187
Do you want to add details for another server?(Y/N) : y
Please enter Server IP or Hostname: 1.4.209.53
Do you want to add details for another server?(Y/N) : n

Username is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Username for these servers? (Y/N) : N
Enter Username for 1.4.217.131: administrator
Enter Username for 1.4.217.187: alansmith
Enter Username for 1.4.209.53: timhorton

Password is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Password for these servers? (Y/N) : N
Enter Password for 1.4.217.131: ************
Enter Password for 1.4.217.187: ************
Enter Password for 1.4.209.53: ************
```

This command shows a basic usage scenario where only the cmdlet name is entered.
You are asked if the same credentials are to be used for multiple input servers or if separate credentials have to be collected for each server.
Then you are asked if the same values for parameters are to be passed to the cmdlets or separate parameters are going to be used for each server.
A list of iLO details is passed to the cmdlet in the form of PowerShell object or list of PowerShell objects or list of IP addresses of the iLO.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOVLAN -Server $Server -EnableNIC $EnableNIC -SharedNetworkPort $SharedNetworkPort -$VLANEnabled $VLANEnabled -VLANID $VLANID

Username is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Username for these servers? (Y/N) : Y
Please enter Username : alansmith

Password is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Password for these servers? (Y/N) : Y
Please enter Password : ************
```

$Server is passed as parameter to Set-HPiLOVLAN.
It can be a string array having iLO IP addresses in string format or it can be an array of PowerShell objects having iLO details including IP address. 
Because the username and passwords are not provided for the iLOs, you are asked to input these values.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOVLAN -Server $Server -Username $Username -Password $Password -EnableNIC $EnableNIC -SharedNetworkPort $SharedNetworkPort -$VLANEnabled $VLANEnabled -VLANID $VLANID
```

This command shows that the list of iLO server addresses is passed as a parameter along with usernames and passwords.

## PARAMETERS

### -Server
Specifies the list of iLO with details in PowerShell object format or in a string format.
The PowerShell object may contain fields such as IP Address, Hostname, spn, fwri, pn, MAC address.
The object may also contain the userid and password required to access the iLO.
A range of iLO IPs can also be provided in the same string.
IPv6 values for IP address can be used on iLO3 firmware version 1.70 and later and also on iLO4 firmware version 1.40 and later.

It can be a single string or it can be a collection of usernames in the form of a string array.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableNIC
Enables the NIC to reflect the state of iLO.
The values are Yes, Y, Enable and On to enable NIC to reflect state of iLO or No, N, Disable and Off to disable NIC to reflect state of iLO.
It is case insensitive.
If the parameter is not specified, the value for the parameter is preserved.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)

```

### -SharedNetworkPort
sets the Shared Network Port value.
The values are LOM, FlexibleLOM or No.
For iLO, the Shared Network Port feature is only available on servers with hardware, NIC firmware, and iLO firmware that supports this feature.
This command is supported on all 300, 500, 700 and 900 ML/DL servers, though not all values, (LOM or FlexibleLOM), are supported on all servers.
NOTE: Due to a branding change, the SharedNetworkPort values have changed.
For iLO 3, the values are Yes and No.
For iLO 4 1.01, the values are LOM, FlexLOM, Yes, and No.
For iLO 4 1.05 and later, the values are LOM, FlexibleLOM, Yes and No. 
When using the iLO Shared Network Port, flashing the iLO firmware through the XML interface takes approximately 7 minutes to complete.
Flashing the firmware using Shared Network Port with iLO does not take any longer to complete than using the dedicated iLO management port.

For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### PSObject OR array of PSObject OR String OR array of String
You can pipe one IP address or a list of IP addresses as Strings, or one PSObject or list of PSObjects having the iLO details such as IP Address, Hostname, Username and Password to access the iLO.

## OUTPUTS

### 
Use Get-Member to get details of fields in returned objects.

## NOTES
Some forms of command line parameters must be enclosed in quotes for correct interpretation by the system.
For example a string parameter of 1234 is interpreted as a number instead of a string without quotes.
An IP address set of 10.10.10.11,33 would also be misinterpreted. 
Use either "1234" or "10.10.10.11,33" to get the expected results.
