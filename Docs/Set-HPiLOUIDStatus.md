# Set-HPiLOUIDStatus

## SYNOPSIS
Toggles the UID on the host server.
(C) Copyright 2013, 2014 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-HPiLOUIDStatus [-OutputType <String>] [-Username <Object>] [-Password <Object>] [-Credential <Object>]
 [-Force] [-Server <Object>] [-UIDControl <Object>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Set-HPiLOUIDStatus cmdlet toggles the UID on the host server in which the iLO is executing.
The Unit ID(UID) light will be flashing if the server is engaged in an activity that can not or should not be interrupted (such as updating iLO firmware or an active Remote Console session).
This script will not change the status of a flashing Unit ID light until the activity causing the flashing status is completed.
A list of servers(with or without port number) and corresponding username/password or credential values must be provided as parameters.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOUIDStatus
Please enter Server IP or Hostname: 1.4.217.131,187
Do you want to add details for another server?(Y/N) : y
Please enter Server IP or Hostname: 1.4.209.53
Do you want to add details for another server?(Y/N) : n

Username is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Username for these servers? (Y/N) : N
Enter Username for 1.4.217.131: administrator
Enter Username for 1.4.217.187: alansmith
Enter Username for 1.4.209.53: timhorton

Password is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Password for these servers? (Y/N) : N
Enter Password for 1.4.217.131: ************
Enter Password for 1.4.217.187: ************
Enter Password for 1.4.209.53: ************

UIDControl is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same UIDControl for these servers? (Y/N) : N
Enter UIDControl for 1.4.217.131: Yes
Enter UIDControl for 1.4.217.187: Yes
Enter UIDControl for 1.4.209.53: No
```

This example shows the usage where only the cmdlet name is entered.
The user is asked if same credentials are to be used for multiple input servers or if separate credentials have to be collected for each server.
Then you are asked if the same values for parameters are to be passed to the cmdlets or separate parameters are going to be used for each server.
A list of iLO details is passed to the cmdlet in the form of PowerShell object or list of PowerShell objects or list of IP addresses of the iLO.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOUIDStatus PSObject -Server $Server -UIDControl @("Yes","Yes","No")

Username is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Username for these servers? (Y/N) : Y
Please enter Username : alansmith

Password is not provided for the following iLO Server(s):
1.4.217.131
1.4.217.187
1.4.209.53
Use same Password for these servers? (Y/N) : Y
Please enter Password : ************
```

This command takes parameters for UIDControl and Server IP address where the Username and password are not given.
Because the username and passwords are not provided for the iLOs, you are asked to input these values.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
PS C:\> $Server | Set-HPiLOUIDStatus
```

$Server is a set of server details piped to the cmdlet.
It can be a string, an array of strings, a PowerShell object with IP address and other server details or an array of PowerShell objects with IP addresses, username, password and the mandatory parameter - UIDStatus.
It may also contain other details.

### EXAMPLE 4
```
PS C:\> $server = @("81.2.84.150", "81.2.88.158", "81.2.88.170")
PS C:\> Set-HPiLOUIDStatus -Server $Server -Username $Username -Password $Password -UIDControl @("Yes","Yes","No")
```

This command shows that the list of iLO server addresses is passed as a parameter along with usernames, passwords, and required parameters.

## PARAMETERS

### -Server
Specifies the list of iLO with details in PowerShell object format or in a string format.
The PowerShell object may contain fields such as IP Address, Hostname, spn, fwri, pn, MAC address.
The object may also contain the userid and password required to access the iLO.
A range of iLO IPs can also be provided in the same string.
IPv6 values for IP address can be used on iLO3 firmware version 1.70 and later and also on iLO4 firmware version 1.40 and later.
Following are examples of server parameters:

Example 1. 
$server = "81.2.84.150"

## INPUTS

### PSObject OR array of PSObject OR String OR array of String
You can pipe a list of PSObject having the iLO details such as IP Address, Hostname, Username and Password to access the iLO.

## OUTPUTS

### 
Use Get-Member to get details of fields in returned objects.

## NOTES
Some forms of command line parameters must be enclosed in quotes for correct interpretation by the system.
For example a string parameter of 1234 is interpreted as a number instead of a string without quotes.
An IP address set of 10.10.10.11,33 would also be misinterpreted. 
Use either "1234" or "10.10.10.11,33" to get the expected results.
